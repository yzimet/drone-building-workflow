# drone-building-workflow
Code challenge: build an interface to draw a shape around a building on a map.

This is a tool to draw a shape on a map, specify a height, and see flight information of how a drone would fly to generate a 3D reconstruction of that building.

## How to run locally
1. clone this repository
2. open `index.html` in a browser

## Dependencies
* [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference) for map and shape drawing
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) for simple CSS grid and styles
